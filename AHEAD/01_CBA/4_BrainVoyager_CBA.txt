- Reconstruct surfaces at 200K vertices
- Proceed with CBA pipeline
- Project atlas (visfatlas) in POI format to subject space -> atlas_poi_to_average_step1.m + average_poi_to_subject_step2.m
- Convert POI to VOI using POI-GUI menu (here we are still at ISO ACPC)
- Write VOI in VMR

We need to go back to the native space:

- Compute transformation matrix between BV_ISO_ACPC e native in ITK-SNAP

Here use:
- 'moving': Ahead_brain_122017_blockface-image_bvbabel_no_inverted_pt5_ACPC_bvbabel.nii.gz
- 'fixed': Ahead_brain_122017_blockface-image.nii.gz

Run ITK registration and save the transformation matrix.
